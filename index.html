            Hi there! I'm Leticia Leon-Rodriguez. I am <em>Third-Year</em>
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> major at
            <strong>Cal Poly SLO</strong>. I am always looking to learn new
            skills and really like to approach problems with an open mind and an
            outside-the-box thinking strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            While at Cal Poly I have been invovled in Cal Poly's Society of Women
            Engineers and am currently serving as Connections Chair as a part of
            the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Core. I have also had the
            opportunity to work as an undergraduate research assistant under Dr.
            Theresa Migler, where I worked on a project that focused on
            analyzing the social network of Cal Poly's Computing Departments in
            order to better understand and better foster community and student's
            mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have truly enjoyed these experiences and am always looking for more ways
            to practice Cal Poly's <em>Learn By Doing</em> idology.
